During a cost-cutting initiative, the sponsor suggests using lower-quality materials that would save $2 million but could compromise the long-term safety and environmental impact. The project manager knows this violates ethical standards but the sponsor is pressuring for approval. What principle should guide the project manager's decision?",
                options: [
                    "Focus on Value - the savings provide immediate value to stakeholders",
                    "Tailor Based on Context - cost pressures justify adapting quality standards",

A steward considers long-term impacts and makes ethical choices that protect stakeholders, even when unpopular. Choosing short-term savings over long-term safety and environmental responsibility would violate this core principle.",

Which PMBOK 7 principle is most critical to address this situation?",

However, the team has already invested 1,000 hours in its development. What should the project manager do based on the Focus on Value principle?",
