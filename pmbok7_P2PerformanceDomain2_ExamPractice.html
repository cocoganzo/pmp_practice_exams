The project manager notices that these conflicts are affecting team morale and delaying progress. What is the MOST effective approach for handling this situation according to the Team Performance Domain?",
                options: [
                    "Transfer one of the developers to another project to eliminate the conflict",
                    "Use a collaborative approach to facilitate discussion and find a mutually acceptable solution",
                    "Implement a competitive approach where the best solution wins based on objective criteria",

                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "According to the Team Performance Domain, using a collaborative (win-win) approach to conflict resolution is most effective. This approach involves facilitating open discussion between the conflicting parties to understand each other's perspectives and work together to find a mutually acceptable solution. Collaboration fosters trust and strengthens team relationships while addressing the root cause of conflicts. Transferring team members avoids the issue, competitive approaches create winners and losers, and avoidance allows conflicts to escalate and impact team performance."

According to the Team Performance Domain, what stage of team development is this team likely experiencing?",

                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "This team is experiencing the forming stage, which is the first stage of team development where team members are getting to know each other and are often hesitant to share ideas or communicate openly. During this stage, team members tend to work independently and are cautious in their interactions. The storming stage involves conflicts and disagreements, the norming stage shows team members understanding each other's strengths and supporting each other, and the performing stage is when the team reaches peak performance."

                    "Micromanaging all team activities to ensure quality and consistency",

                explanation: "The Team Performance Domain emphasizes empowerment as a key factor for high-performing teams. Delegating authority and trusting team members to make decisions independently leads to better results and increased motivation. Empowered team members who can make decisions without constant micromanagement demonstrate higher ownership and satisfaction. Micromanagement, centralized decision-making, and limiting authority contrary to the principle of empowerment and can stifle team performance and creativity."
