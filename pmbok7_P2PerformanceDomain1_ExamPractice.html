According to the Stakeholder Performance Domain, what is the MOST appropriate tool to categorize and prioritize these stakeholders?",

This helps project managers prioritize engagement efforts and determine appropriate strategies for different stakeholder groups. While a risk register, communication plan, and RACI matrix are valuable project management tools, they don't serve the specific purpose of stakeholder categorization and prioritization based on influence and interest."

These stakeholders can significantly impact the project through their authority, so ensuring they remain satisfied with the project's direction and outcomes is crucial. 'Manage Closely' is for high power, high interest stakeholders; 'Keep Informed' is for low power, high interest stakeholders; and 'Monitor' is for low power, low interest stakeholders."
