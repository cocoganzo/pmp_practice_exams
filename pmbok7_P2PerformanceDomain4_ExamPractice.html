                options: [
                    "Implement a strict Waterfall approach since it provides the most structure",
                    "Use pure Agile methodology as it's the most modern approach",
                    "Tailor processes based on project needs, team capabilities, and organizational context",

                ],
                correct: 2,
                explanation: "The Project Work Performance Domain emphasizes process customization to optimize work according to the project's specific needs. The correct approach is to tailor processes based on project needs, team capabilities, and organizational context. Simply copying processes or rigidly following one methodology without considering the project's unique characteristics goes against the principle of customization. Effective processes should be both efficient and effective, adhering to quality requirements while producing desired results."

                    "Hire additional team members to reduce the overall workload",

                ],
                correct: 2,
                explanation: "The Project Work Performance Domain emphasizes keeping project team motivation and concentration high through workload balance and employee satisfaction. The primary focus should be on balancing workload and monitoring team motivation and satisfaction. While hiring additional resources or extending deadlines might be solutions, they don't directly address the root cause of uneven workload distribution. Mandatory overtime would likely worsen burnout rather than resolve it."

                question: "A project has an Earned Value (EV) of $180,000, Planned Value (PV) of $200,000, and Actual Cost (AC) of $190,000. What is the Schedule Performance Index (SPI) and what does it indicate?",

                    "SPI = 1.11, indicating the project is ahead of schedule",
                    "SPI = 0.95, indicating the project is slightly behind schedule",

                ],
                correct: 0,
                explanation: "Schedule Performance Index (SPI) = EV / PV = $180,000 / $200,000 = 0.90. An SPI less than 1.0 indicates the project is behind schedule. Specifically, an SPI of 0.90 means the project is earning only 90 cents of value for every dollar of work that was planned to be completed.
